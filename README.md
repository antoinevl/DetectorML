# MSc-project
## Roadmap
- [ ] Sanitize benign and malicious datasets
- [ ] Build a crawler and extract code from URLs
  with:
  - [x] urllib2
  - [ ] Selenium Grid
- [ ] Features
  - [ ] Choose best
  - [x] Extract from crawled webpages
- [ ] Machine Learning
  - [ ] Label items correctly 
  - [ ] Choose classifiers
  - [ ] Implementation in Python
  - [ ] Validation: 10-cross fold averaged
  - [ ] Extra validation dataset
  - [ ] Compare features / classifiers
- [ ] Performance

## TODO
- [ ] [Unit testing](https://docs.python.org/2/library/unittest.html)
- [ ] sklearn
  - [ ] [SVM](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/svm.html)
  - [ ] [PCA](http://sebastianraschka.com/Articles/2014_pca_step_by_step.html): reduce the dimensionality of features in order to plot the results fairly.
- [ ] Logs
- [ ] Stats / performance measures

## Issues
SVM: takes only numerical values
